# NDC-Game
Game that my group and I made for the Nuit Du Code event.

The version we made was not up to our expectations, so I decided to continue it on my side, even if it won't change anything in our ranking.
It will allow me to gain knowledge and experience, because some of the packages I will use in this project are totally unknown to me and will be a total discovery.

Everything is in public, so don't hesitate to have a look and to offer me your opinions (positive or negative, everything is good to take! ), your suggestions, as well as your advice!
